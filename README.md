Sorting Top 50 Songs by Various Factors
This Python script sorts a CSV file called "top50.csv" that contains data on the top 50 songs of a certain time period, by various factors such as beats per minute, energy, and danceability. The user is prompted to choose a song by its number, and the script moves the chosen song to the top of the list after sorting.
